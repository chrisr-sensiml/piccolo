Other Useful Features
---------------------

We are about to move to the next application in the SensiML Toolkit called the Analytics Studio. Before we go, let's take a quick look at a few useful features that we did not cover in this guide.

Import Files from External Sources
``````````````````````````````````

Have you already collected your own dataset? The Data Studio can import external files into SensiML's file format. See more about the file format in the :doc:`/data-studio/importing-external-sensor-data` tutorial

Media Player
````````````

The Data Studio can play WAV, MP4, and MOV files with your sensor data to make identifying your events of interest easier. See more about playing videos at the link: :doc:`Playing videos in the Data Studio</data-studio/playing-videos>`

The Data Studio can record videos during data collection if you setup the SensiML Open Gateway application. See more on this feature in the :doc:`/open-gateway/recording-webcam-videos` tutorial
