Playing Your Video
``````````````````

The Data Studio automatically adjusts your sensor file to line up with the start/end of the video. When you start playing the video you will see a timeline move across your sensor data.

1. See the screenshot below. There is a blue timeline that moves across the data, with the exact sample number in the bottom left corner
