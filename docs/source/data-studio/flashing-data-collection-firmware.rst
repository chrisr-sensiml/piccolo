Flashing Data Collection Firmware
=================================

In order to do live data collection from a device in the Data Studio, the device must be flashed with compatible data collection firmware

.. note:: The Data Studio has an option to import external sensor data via CSV or WAV files if you have your own method of collecting sensor data from a device. See more on importing external sensor data in the :doc:`Importing External Sensor Data Documentation<importing-external-sensor-data>`
