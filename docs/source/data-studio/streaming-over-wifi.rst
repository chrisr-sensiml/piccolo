Streaming Over Wi-Fi
````````````````````

The Data Studio can connect to devices/gateways that implement the :doc:`simple streaming Wi-Fi protocol <../simple-streaming-specification/simple-wifi-streaming>`. Before you connect to a device/gateway that is Wi-Fi enabled, verify that the Data Studio Device Plugin has been configured with **Wi-Fi** by opening the sensor configuration **Connection Settings**. If your device does not have a Wi-Fi connection setting, you may need to create a new device plugin with a Wi-Fi connection option. See how to create a new device plugin in the :doc:`Adding Custom Device Firmware documentation<adding-custom-device-firmware>`.
