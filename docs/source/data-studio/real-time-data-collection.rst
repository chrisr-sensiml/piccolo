   :description: How to use the Data Studio for doing real-time data collection from your sensor

Real-Time Data Collection
=========================

The Data Studio can perform real-time data collection and labeling from any sensor over Serial COM, Bluetooth-LE, or Wi-Fi radios. You can use any third-party device in the Data Studio by updating the device firmware to our open-source Simple Streaming specification.
