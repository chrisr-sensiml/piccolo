Continuous vs Discrete Events
-----------------------------

The type of event you are trying to detect will change the way you label your event. Events will typically fall into two types: continuous and discrete.

Continuous Events

Continuous events are labeled by using a **manual session**. You will normally have a single segment over the entire length of the event. See the user guide for how to label continuous events at the link: :doc:`Getting Started Guide<../guides/getting-started/quick-start-project>`

See a screenshot of a **continuous event** below. Notice that there is only one segment in the file and the segment extends the entire length of the file:

Discrete Events
```````````````

**Discrete events** should be labeled by using an **auto session**. You will normally have many events in a single file. Download the user guide for how to label discrete events at the link :download:`Labeling Discrete Events </data-studio/file/Labeling-Discrete-Events.pdf>`.

See a screenshot of **discrete events** below. Notice that there are many segments in the file:
