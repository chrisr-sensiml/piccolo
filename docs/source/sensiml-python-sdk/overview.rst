   :description: Get started using the SensiML Python SDK

Overview
========

The SensiML Python SDK is a library that provides a programmatic interface to SensiML APIs through python.

You can think of the Analytics Studio as the front-end to the SensiML Python SDK. The Analytics Studio uses the APIs in the SensiML Python SDK to generate a model. The SensiML APIs give you full access to the tools so you can customize functions, training algorithms, features, tuning parameters, data augmentation techniques, and classifiers through code. We suggest starting with the Analytics Studio to generate your model, but by using the SensiML APIs you can do even more with projects that have advanced requirements.

In short, the SensiML Python SDK gives you a more flexible approach to go beyond the Analytics Studio to expand and explore your datasets in new and exciting ways through python.
