Overview
--------

The Analytics Studio is a web application that filters and optimizes your labeled sensor data through machine learning algorithms. It generates a model (SensiML Knowledge Pack) ready to be flashed into the firmware of your device of choice. The most powerful part of the Knowledge Pack is that it will be detecting events on the low memory sensor without ever requiring a connection to the cloud.
