Projects contain Labels and Metadata to describe your events of interest and files in a project. At this screen you can add, edit, and delete Labels and Metadata.

**Labels**

Labels are how you will describe the events of interest in your application. For example a Slide Demo might have *Vertical*, *Stationary*, and *Horizontal* as the labels.

**Metadata**

Metadata are custom properties that you can save to the files in your project that allow you to filter your sensor data based on characteristics of the files. Metadata properties are normally attributes about the subject or object you are recording.
