Overview
````````

The SensiML Analytics Toolkit comes preconfigured to build AI sensor models directly for a variety of third-party devices listed in our :doc:`Supported Devices Documentation<../../index>`.

If you are using third-party hardware not listed in the supported devices, the SensiML Toolkit can interface with your device with a few additional steps. This tutorial describes the protocols, supporting documentation, and reference code needed for SensiML users to adapt their customized board firmware and SensiML software configuration to properly interface and work with the SensiML Toolkit.
