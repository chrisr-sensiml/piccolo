=============================
Building Recognition Firmware
=============================

The SensiML Analytics Studio supports building recognition firmware (Knowledge Packs) for any hardware platform described in the :doc:`Knowledge Packs Documentation<../../knowledge-packs/flashing-a-knowledge-pack-to-an-embedded-device>`.

**Supported Compilers** (Arm, x86, Android NDK) can generate library or source code firmware ready to be integrated onto your platform of choice.

**Supported Devices/Development Platforms** can generate binary, library, or source code firmware ready for flashing to the device without having to utilize separate tools.
