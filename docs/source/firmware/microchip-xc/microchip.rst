We support building Knowledge Pack libraries which can be included as part of your application code for Microchip processors using the Microchip XC8/XC16/XC32 Compiler.

For custom hardware, you will need to implement your own data collection and recognition firmware. 

You can follow our :doc:`Simple Streaming Interface<../../simple-streaming-specification/introduction>` to implement data capture to connect to the Data Studio. You can also import .csv or .wav files directly. 

You can follow our :doc:`Knowledge Pack Library<../../knowledge-packs/building-a-knowledge-pack-library>` for instructions on including the machine learning library in your application. 

To download the library, select Microchip XC8/XC16/XC32 in the Download Model page along with the appropriate processor for your platform.
