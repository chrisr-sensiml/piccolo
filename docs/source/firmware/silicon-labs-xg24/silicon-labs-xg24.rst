The xG24 Dev Kit is a compact, feature-packed development platform. The development platform supports up to +10dBm output power and includes support for the 20-bit ADC as well as other key features such as the xG24's AI/ML hardware accelerator. You can find more information on the Silicon Labs xG24 Dev Kit at `<https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/efr32xg24-dev-kit>`_

This guide will go over how to set up the Silicon Labs xG24 Dev Kit firmware for data collection or recognition. Once your device is configured, you can find a tutorial on how to use the SensiML Toolkit software in the :doc:`SensiML Getting Started Tutorial</guides/getting-started/overview>`.

Example Data Collection Firmware
--------------------------------

In order to use the xG24 board for data collection it must be flashed with data collection firmware. We provide example firmware for using either the IMU (Accelerometer/Gyroscope) or Audio (Microphone) sensors below. We will go over how to build the firmware in Simplicity Studio in the next sections.

Example Recognition Firmware
----------------------------

In order to use the xG24 board in recognition mode it must be flashed with recognition firmware. We provide example firmware source code for using either the IMU (Accelerometer/Gyroscope) or Audio (Microphone) sensors below. We will go over how to include your Model/Knowledge Pack in your firmware in the Flashing Knowledge Pack/Recognition Firmware section.

Initial Setup For Building Firmware
-----------------------------------

Firmware in this guide is flashed and compiled using Silicon Labs Simplicity Studio 5.

1. Install Simplicity Studio 5 at `<https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio>`_

Before building or flashing the firmware, verify that the xG24 adapter firmware is up to date.

2. Open the **Launcher** tab in Simplicity Studio and check the status of the **Adapter FW** under **General Information**. The status should be ``Latest``, if the status is ``Update`` then click the update link to download the latest version for the adapter firmware.

3. The example firmware in this guide uses a serial port connection. A debug VCOM port needs to be set up to use a serial connection. In the **Debug Adapters** window, Right + Click on the xG24 Dev Kit and select **Launch Consoleâ€¦** from the drop-down menu.

.. figure:: /firmware/silicon-labs-xg24/img/launch_console.png

4. In the Console window select the **Admin** tab and type ``serial vcom config speed 921600`` into the terminal input window and press **Enter**.

Your board is now ready for serial connections.

Building Firmware From a Pre-Built Hex File
-------------------------------------------

1. Download and unzip the pre-built hex file from the **Example Data Collection Firmware** section above.

2. Select the **Flash Programmer** button from the toolbar in Simplicity Studio.

3. Click **Browse** to select the hex file you wish to flash and click **Program**

Flashing can also be done through running the debugger. The debugger will first flash your application and allow for breakpoints to be set. The application will remain in flash until another program replaces it.


Building Firmware From Source Code
----------------------------------

1. Download or clone the **source code** from the **Example Firmware** sections above.

2. Select File -> Import in Simplicity Studio.

.. figure:: /firmware/silicon-labs-xg24/img/simplicity-studio-import1.png

3. Navigate to the ``SimplicityStudio`` folder from the and select the **.SLS** file for the project.

4. Click **Finish** and Simplicity Studio will set up your workspace for building from source code.

5. Build the source code by clicking the **Build** button

6. *(Optional)* You can debug the source code with breakpoints by clicking the **Debug** button. You may need to set up a bootloader before you can debug.

Adding New Sensors to the Data Studio
-------------------------------------

The Data Studio includes a built-in device plugin for the xG24 Dev Kit *IMU* and *Audio* sensors. You can add additional sensors to your board and use them for data collection in the Data Studio by creating a custom device plugin. You can create a device plugin by defining your sensor information in an SSF file and importing it to the Data Studio. We provide an example SSF file for your device plugin named ``EFR32xG24-Dev-Kit-Board.ssf`` in the SensiML GitHub repository at `<https://github.com/sensiml/SensiML_xG24_IMU_Capture>`__.

For more details on defining SSF file properties and implementing the Simple Streaming specification in your firmware see the :doc:`Adding Custom Device Firmware Documentation</data-studio/adding-custom-device-firmware>`.

Changing IMU Frequency/Sample Rate for Data Collection
------------------------------------------------------

The frequency/sample rate that IMU data collection firmware outputs is set at compile-time when you build from source code.

1. Open the file ``app_sensor_imu.h``.

2. Update ``#define ACCEL_GYRO_DEFAULT_ODR`` to set the frequency.

3. Re-build the device firmware.

Flashing Knowledge Pack/Recognition Firmware
--------------------------------------------

1. Download a Knowledge Pack Library from the Analytics Studio.

.. figure:: /firmware/silicon-labs-xg24/img/download-silabs-xg24-kp.png
   :align: center

The Silicon Labs xG24 Dev Kit also includes the Matrix Vector Processor for accelerating Neural Network Ops. Select the **Hardware Accelerator** to take advantage of the processor.

2. Unzip the Knowledge Pack files.

   :align: center

3. Follow the instructions for **Building Firmware From Source Code** above to import one of the **Example Recognition Firmware** projects into Simplicity Studio. This will create either a ``sensiml_recogition_motion`` or ``sensiml_recogition_audio`` workspace depending on the project you selected.

4. Replace the ``knowledgepack`` folder inside your workspace with the ``knowledgepack`` folder you extracted from the download and re-build the firmware.

Viewing Knowledge Pack Recognition Results
------------------------------------------

When a Knowledge Pack is flashed on the board, the classification results can be viewed by connecting to the virtual COM port in a terminal application. Follow the steps below for viewing the recognition results:

1. Open a terminal emulator (such as Tera Term)
2. Set your serial speed to 921600
3. Create a new connection to your xG24 Dev Kit COM port

You will now see classification results printed in the terminal
